        I've done half of this tier on WAR and i really liked it, but i recently got GNB to 90 and fell in love with it. I don't really want to abandon WAR and ideally i'd like to swap between the two. I know WAR is a pain in the ass to use with other tanks since it doesn't use DH melds. So if i were to leave out DH materia for my gunbreaker melds, how serious would the damage loss be?

Important note: I dont really plan on doing optimisation runs, mostly interested in current and future prog. (If im doing week one prog I'd choose one tank and BIS meld) But I also dont want to get rejected from statics because of the damage loss on my gunbreaker.

Am i doomed to grind out a second gearset for my gunbreaker? Or waste a bunch of materia?
